DISCO:
 * unlike in foundation, images in cards need to be tagged with class="card-img-top" or something similar
 * <div class="p-3 border bg-light"> --> p-3 changes the top and bottom margin lengths

QCC:
* what's up with the margin on the right?? we spent a solid 30 minutes trying ot get rid of it with no avail
* it seems a lot harder to properly center things in bootstrap than in foundation

q1 (only to be answered after you have finished… At this point, which FEF do you prefer, and why?)
We're both slightly leaning towards foundation, though both seem equally good for the most part. 
Foundation seems to have better graphics and (from what we've seen) allows us to control of widgets and objects more! For example, we had some frustration with Bootstrap and not being able to center elements correctly, but we didn't have that problem with Foundation
