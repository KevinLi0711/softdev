                            Hi im Sana! I'm a Penguin from another world. 
                            I arrived on 66 million years ago when I crashed into Earth. I arrived in a rather unfortunate manner though, as I accidentally killed the dinosaurs.
                            I met Watson as soon as I woke up. They were standing right beside me in the middle of a massive crater.
                            Since then we've been best friends and although we've been separated at times, we've stayed pen pals!
                            If you're wondering how we managed that in an age before paper, the answer is telepathy. Duh.
                            Since last year, I've found a home with a certain aspiring devo, and as it turns out, Watson had found a devo friend too.
                            It just so happens that our devo friends happened to meet, so Watson and I have been reunited!
                            We're going to need a lot of time to catch up. I have millions of years worth of observations to share!

                            Greetings! My name's Watson, although that's what my current partner in crime has called me.
                            Since then I've watched Earth grow with it's organisms. I've even had the pleasure of meeting 
                            beings form all around our world and others! For example, my friend Sana and I had the pleasure 
                            of meeting quite some time ago! Some 66...million years ago. I helped her when she fell onto Earth,
                            unintentionally killing the dinosaurs, and together we explored what there was left of Earth. Unfortunately,
                            we got separated from a violent attack by the Lizard-Fish attacks, 55 million years ago.
                            But imagine my surprise when I find out that my person knew and was working with Sana's! They were exploring
                            realm of computer science and software develpment. Gone are the days of telepathic communication and terrible
                            postal service waiting time! Sana and I have since then, decided to catch up and discuss, in depth, the numerous
                            observations we've both made in our time apart.
