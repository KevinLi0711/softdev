Observations
    - the static/foo file with no file extension gets downlaoded when we tried going to its page
    - the foo.html file has its contents displayed

Prediction: .py files in the static folder will not run
    - the contents of the .py file are displayed on the website

Prediction: A method bound to the route of static/foo will override what's in static/foo
    - the text returned by the bound method is displayed on the website instead of the contents of static/foo

Prediction: .md and files in static will get downloaded because the text on the website is displayed using html, so a different format might not work
    - .md files did get downloaded but likely not for the reason mentioned
    - .txt files got displayed, which is strange since the plaintext static/foo file got downloaded
    - .json files also get displayed
    - .csv, .java, and .exe got downloaded

Prediction: the files in static get run once upon booting up the website and not upon reloading
    - files in static don't get run
