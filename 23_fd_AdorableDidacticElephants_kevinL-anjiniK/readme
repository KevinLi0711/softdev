DISCO:
 * just by linking the foundation stylesheet, you get access to a css file with new stylings
 * existing things like forms get visually revamped
 * you can type in . followed by the name of a class name and hit tab to autofill it into a div with class = <inputted class name>
 ```
 .row
 ```
 becomes
 ```
 <div class="row"></div>
 ```
 * this is useful because foundation adds css styling to a bunch of classes that make formatting websites more convenient. For example, the line above with class="row" adds everything inside the <div> on a new line
 * can download an entire page template or portions of it 
 * rest apis come in handy when you want to add random cat pictures to your html page

QCC: 
 * How are you meant to use Foundation building blocks without installing anything and without making a new file for the extra css?
